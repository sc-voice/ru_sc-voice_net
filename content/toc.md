### Welcome to ${appName}

HTML content for your website is sourced from 
files in the `content` directory.

Files:

* [Markdown files with suffix .md](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) are converted automatically to HTML when committed to Github.
* Use directories to group related files
* `toc.md` files provide directory level information

See [sc-voice.net on Github](https://github.com/sc-voice/sc-voice_net/tree/main/content) for additional content examples.
Copy and translate these files as you like.
